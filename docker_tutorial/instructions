- Clone the repository to your local machine using
	git clone git@github.com:ETH-NEXUS/Workshop_RDMS_BSSE_retreat.git
- Navigate to the subdirectory "Workshop_RDMS_BSSE_retreat/docker_tutorial
- You will find the two main component for a simple docker container
	- example_plot.R: This is a simple script that we want to run inside a container. It can be any kind of script, workflow of pipeline
	- Dockerfile: This is the recipe to build the docker image
- Build the image:
	docker build -t docker_example .
- Images can be listed using:
	docker images
- Run the container:
	docker run --volume=</path/to/host/dir>:/output docker_example

The --volume option binds a directory of your system (on the left side of the colon) to a directory in the container (right side of the colon).
This allows the container to read from and write to that directory, ensuring the output can be retrieved.
HINT: --volume requires full paths. Change </path/to/host/dir> to the full path to the directory you wish the output to be saved to
